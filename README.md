# Email-Checker
This is the email checker (python version) that you can have in the process of email verification from the Wati-Dev

So to make this program work you just have to download the main.py file and run it with python

You will then receive an email from you with a code inside which python will ask you to enter to check it

WARNING WIP : USE ONLY ON FOR THE FIRST EMAIL ASKED AN HOTMAIL ACCOUNT, THE SECOND CAN BE ANY TYPE OF EMAIL ADRESS. IM WORKING ON THE PROJECT TO MAKE GMAIL WORKS TOO
